To better coordinate data collection from the client, we have setup a group email address which will forward the client&#039;s email to relevant personnel. The purpose of creating this group email is to ensure that there is no single bottle-neck when comes to handling of client&#039;s content.
</p>
<pre class="code">The group email address : submit@ounch.com
Will be forwarded to: KF, Joy &amp; Lishan</pre>

<p>
After sorting out the content, the email can then be forwarded to different people in the company to perform the actual tasks.

<em>Do take note that all “request” of work should be submitted to Asana for easier tracking.  As this request is internal, we are not using Ticketing System to handle this.</em>

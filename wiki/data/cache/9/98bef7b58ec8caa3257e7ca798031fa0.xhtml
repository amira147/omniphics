This purpose of this site is to provide detail documentation of all Ounch solutions.
</p>

<p>
For the Wiki to be useful, it is important for all staff to ensure that the quality of the content are maintained. As the saying goes, “Garbage In, Garbage Out”. The more detail the documenting, the more useful it will be for us. So, do take special effort when submitting your “knowledge”.
</p>

<p>
Is there any guidelines for what topic to write? The rule of thumb is: anything that only you know how to do. :)

Finally, do note that this Wiki is a collection of the company&#039;s “knowledge”, it&#039;s intellectual property.  Although all the information is made to share within the company, do ensure that it remains in the company and not shared with unauthorized personal.

<p>
Lastly, happy writing!
